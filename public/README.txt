Data Visualisation is a Web App developed using MERN Stack. It is a dashboard which presents graphs and charts designed and drawn using the data fetched from dataVisualisation database using a self designed API. Additionally a few filters are invloved to dynamically alter the graphs based on the user inputs.

The database used here is MongoDB with Atlas service and is generated using the jsondata.json file provided with the problem statement.

NodeJs is used to initialise and handle the backend server and controlling the API.

The frontend is designed with the help of ReactJs. Every graph is made as an individual react component. They extract the required variables from the fetched data and manipulate them to calculate graph entries and then design the graphs.

In UI some dummy elements(No funcitonality has been added to them) are invloved just to make it more attractive.
Only the graphs and filters are active elements.

The website is responsive till these minimum dimensions: 725 x 605 .
